# Unsplash Wallpaper Downloader

This Python script allows you to automatically download and set random wallpapers from Unsplash as your desktop wallpaper. It fetches images from Unsplash using their API and updates your wallpaper at scheduled intervals.

## Prerequisites

- Python: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Replace `'your_unsplash_access_key'` with your actual Unsplash API access key in the Python script. You can obtain an API key by signing up for a Unsplash developer account and creating a new application.
